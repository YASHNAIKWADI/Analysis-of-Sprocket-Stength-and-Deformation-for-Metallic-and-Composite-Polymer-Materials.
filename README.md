# Analysis of Sprocket Strength and Deformation for Metallic and Composite Polymer Materials

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comparative finite element analysis (FEA) of a chain sprocket modeled using three different materials:
- C45 Carbon Steel  
- PA66-GF30 (Glass Fiber Reinforced Nylon)  
- Kevlar-49 Composite  

The objective is to evaluate structural behavior and material suitability for power transmission applications.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a standard chain sprocket using Solid Edge 2025  
- Perform static structural analysis in ANSYS 2025 R2  
- Compare total deformation, von Mises stress, mass, and volume  
- Identify the best material based on strength-to-weight ratio

## 📈 Key Results
| Material | Deformation (m) | Von Mises Stress (Pa) | Mass (kg) |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|-----------|
| C45 Steel | 9.11 × 10⁻⁷ | 2.45 × 10⁶ | 5.95 |
| PA66-GF30 | 1.97 × 10⁻⁵ | 2.23 × 10⁶ | 1.016 |
| Kevlar-49 | 1.97 × 10⁻⁵ | 3.27 × 10⁶ | 1.092 |

## 🔍 Conclusion
- C45 steel offers maximum stiffness and lowest deformation but is heavy  
- PA66-GF30 provides the best cost-to-performance ratio  
- Kevlar-49 shows excellent strength-to-weight ratio suitable for high-performance systems
